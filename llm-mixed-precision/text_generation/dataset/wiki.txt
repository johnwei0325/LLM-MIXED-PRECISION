" Of the action sequences , he said , " Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and <unk> bad special effects . The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture .

" Roger Moore remarked , " I thought it just went too far – and that ’ s from me , the first Bond in space ! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage ? Please ! "
